<h1>Sphere DAO</h1>
Introducing a revolutionary research paper publishing platform that eliminates middlemen and barriers to entry, providing researchers with direct exposure to their target audience. Our platform uses peer review to ensure the quality and authenticity of papers, while readers can drop reviews and make informed decisions. With a focus on transparency and fairness, our Web3 startup is poised to disrupt the traditional publishing industry. Join us in shaping the future of research paper publishing.

## How It Works
- Researchers can upload their papers and pay a minimal proposal fee to create a proposal for peer review.
- Editors can approve or disapprove proposals to be put out in DAO for review.
- DAO members can vote on the proposals and get a portion of the proposal fee added to their return stake for every proposal they vote on.
- Anytime members or editors can leave the DAO and get their stake returned.
- Non-DAO members can access these articles by paying a one-time fee.
